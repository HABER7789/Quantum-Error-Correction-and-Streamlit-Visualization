# Quantum Error Correction and Streamlit Visualization

For reliable quantum computations, error correction is an essential requirement. Quantum computers are inherently error-prone, and addressing errors in quantum bits (qubits) is challenging due to the inability to copy information like classical bits. Qubits lose information when interacting with the external environment, disrupting the delicate quantum state. Error correction methods are crucial to prevent information loss.

This project illustrates the concept of error correction using Qiskit in Python and visualizes quantum circuits, along with results after applying error correction gates in the form of Bloch sphere and histogram. While complex error correction methods like surface codes are used in large-scale quantum computations, this project provides a simplified demonstration of error correction techniques.

üîç Key Features:

- Visualize quantum circuits implementing error correction techniques.
- Simulate and correct bit-flip errors using CNOT and Toffoli gates.
- Explore the Bloch sphere representation of quantum states.

I have included two python files, one with Streamlit code and the other with simple bit flip function code which can be used to generate ouptut in terminal itself. 
- ErrorCorrection.py
- ErrorCorrectionUI.py
